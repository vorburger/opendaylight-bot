The ODL Bot is a software delivery automation tool. It originated in the OpenDaylight.org FLOSS SDN community,
but could be used by other open-source communities (and for in-house proprietary code) as well.  Its features are:

* Multi Git repo Gerrit topic management
  * Multi project builds and status tracking
  * Simultaneously merge changes based on a topic

Ideas for future features include:
* Automated upstream downstream repo syncing
* Multi project "version bumping looking ahead" builds
* â€¦
